            <p> Hey, I'm Kacey! As a UX/UI & Graphic Designer, I love helping others bring their ideas to life. I'm passionate about ensuring that my clients get exactly what they want while also solving the problem to the best of my ability.<br><br>
                Before pursuing a career in design, I worked in the food industry but I knew that I wanted something more. I've always loved creating things whether it was graphics for friends and family members, drawings, or video edits. Designing allows me to fully be myself in a creative world that's constantly expanding every day. Iâ€™m always trying to learn and improve, but I believe that what makes me different is the desire I have to bring happiness to others through design.<br><br>
                Outside of designing I enjoy reading, singing my little heart out, and eating yummy food (specifically honey garlic wings and anything with potatoes).
